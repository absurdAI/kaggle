#High level overview to approaching classification problems:

General Instruction for Classification Problems

1. Understand the Problem
  Clearly define the target variable and understand the features.
  Read the problem statement and data description provided in the competition or project.

2. Load and Inspect the Data
  Load the training and test datasets.
  Inspect the data using head(), info(), and describe() to understand the data structure, types, and missing values.

3. Handle Missing Values
  Identify missing values in both numerical and categorical features.
  For numerical features, consider using techniques like KNN imputation, mean/median imputation, or forward filling.
  For categorical features, use mode imputation, or fill with a placeholder value (e.g., "Unknown").

4. Feature Engineering
  Create new features by transforming or combining existing ones.
  Example: Splitting composite columns, aggregating numerical values, etc.
  Convert categorical variables to numerical ones using techniques like One-Hot Encoding or Label Encoding.

5. Prepare Data for Modeling
  Combine training and test datasets if consistent preprocessing is needed.
  After preprocessing, split the combined dataset back into training and test sets.
  Ensure the target variable is reattached to the training data.

6. Model Selection and Training
  Split the training data into training and validation sets.
  Train different models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, XGBoost) and evaluate their performance.
  Fine-tune hyperparameters as needed.

7. Evaluate the Model
  Use appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score) to evaluate model performance.
  Compare different models and select the best one.

8. Make Predictions on Test Set
  Use the selected model to predict the target variable for the test dataset.
  Ensure predictions are in the required format (e.g., boolean, integer).

9. Prepare and Submit Results
  Prepare the submission file according to the competition's format.
  Save the submission as a CSV file and submit it.
